# AI Chat Bot

## Introduction
The AI Chat Bot is an interactive application that leverages advanced language models to provide users with intelligent responses to their queries. 
Built using Streamlit, this chat bot offers a user-friendly interface where individuals can ask questions and receive answers in real-time. 
The bot utilizes the Agno library to interface with a powerful AI model, making it capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: Users can enter their questions into a text input field.
2. **Processing**: Upon submission, the bot processes the input and generates a response using the underlying AI model.
3. **Response Display**: The generated response is displayed on the web interface, allowing users to see the answer immediately.
4. **Environment Configuration**: The application uses environment variables to securely manage API keys, ensuring that sensitive information is not hard-coded into the application.
